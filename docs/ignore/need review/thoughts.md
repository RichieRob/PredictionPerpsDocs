What do we want the ledger to do?

1) Be a central point where liquidity can be provided across multiple markets?
2) Vertsatile with different market implementations
3) Allocate interest to different buckets for different markets
4) What about resolution? Should the ledger deal with resolution?
5) Redeem set have to think about how this works - for indefinite outcomes there always needs to be an "other" position, but market makers cant sell that unless we implement a process where it splits... which we could do, but just have to get our design straight
6) Finalise  minting when using multiple AMMs just have one final mint event.. (handle multiple routes)
