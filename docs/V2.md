# Perpetual Prediction Markets: V2

## Introduction

### Overview
Traditional prediction markets, like Polymarket, focus on time-bound events such as elections or sports outcomes. While effective for short-term forecasting, they lack support for long-term hedging or sustained positions on recurring phenomena.

### Limitations of Expiring Markets
- **Finite Duration**: Positions expire at event resolution, despite entities like sports teams, political parties, or economic indicators persisting over time.
- **Repetitive Investment**: Users must repurchase contracts each cycle (e.g., season), incurring fees and limiting long-term strategies.
- **Event-Centric Focus**: Markets emphasize one-off events and fail to support speculation on the longevity or sustained state of ongoing phenomena, such as a career’s trajectory or persistent conditions.

## Perpetual Prediction Tokens (PPTs)

### Concept
Perpetual Prediction Tokens (PPTs) are non-expiring tokens designed for markets that enable speculation on recurring or persistent phenomena, supporting long-term "buy and hold" strategies.

### Core Features
- **Indefinite Persistence**: Tokens never expire, allowing continuous market participation.
- **Dividend Payouts**: Holders receive dividends (in USDC) during "true" periods, based on periodic evaluations (e.g., annual) via oracles like UMA.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Token prices adjust to market sentiment, reflecting the discounted probability of future "true" outcomes and their expected duration.
- **Verifiable Outcomes**: Focus on clear, oracle-resolved truth statements.

### Use Cases
- **Sports**: "Liverpool are Premier League Champions," "Crystal Palace are in the Premier League," "Tottenham are in Champions League," "Serena Williams is a top 8 tennis player."
- **Entertainment**: "Taylor Swift is the most streamed artist on Spotify."
- **Economics**: "CPI inflation is greater than 3%."
- **Politics**: "Nigel Farage is Prime Minister," "Labour have a majority in Parliament," "JD Vance is President."
- **Space**: "There are people on Mars," "There are people on the Moon."
- **BTC Mining Threshold**: "BTC >= $50,000."
- **Weather**: "New York Cooling Days over/under X."

## Perpetual vs. Expiring Markets

### Challenges of Expiring Markets
Expiring markets require users to repurchase contracts each cycle, incurring fees and preventing sustained positions. They focus on specific milestones rather than ongoing states or longevity.

For example:

- Betting on "Will Newcastle United win the Premier League?" requires annual repurchasing, ignoring the team’s long-term trajectory.
- Markets like "Keir Starmer is Prime Minister" or "Taylor Swift is the most streamed artist" don’t allow speculation on the duration of their tenure or dominance.
- A market like "Serena Williams is a top 8 tennis player" would focus on breaking into the top 8 for a single season, not her career-long performance.

### How PPTs Solve These Issues
PPTs create fluid, perpetual markets that:
- Allow a single position to cover all future cycles, capturing long-term trends or careers.
- Reward holders with dividends during "true" periods.
- Reflect evolving probabilities through dynamic pricing.

## Key Mechanics

### Token Structure
- **T**: Bullish position (e.g., "Yes, Newcastle is champion").
- **\(\overline{T}\)**: Bearish position (e.g., "No, Newcastle is not champion").
- **Pricing**: Constant sum mechanism (\(P_T + P_{\overline{T}} = 1\) USDC) enables minting/burning for arbitrage.

### Outcome Evaluation
- **Binary Outcomes (V1)**: Conditions are evaluated as "true" or "false" (e.g., annually for sports).
- **Bounded Outcomes (V2)**: Future iterations will support more complex, bounded outcomes.
- **Oracle-Based Resolution**: Verifiable via oracles like UMA.

### Dividend Mechanism
- Dividends (in USDC) are paid only when the condition is "true," based on a predefined rubric.
- Tokens persist indefinitely; yields toggle based on oracle outcomes, with prices reflecting long-term expectations.

### Benefits
- **Long-Term Positions**: Holders can maintain positions without repurchasing.
- **Dividend Rewards**: Sustained success generates ongoing yields.
- **Market Efficiency**: Prices adapt to new information, supporting arbitrage opportunities.

## Example: Newcastle United Premier League Champions

### Outcome
Evaluated annually post-season: "Is Newcastle United the current Premier League champion?"

### Tokens
- **T**: Yes, Newcastle is champion.
- **\(\overline{T}\)**: No, Newcastle is not champion.

### Yields
- If "Yes," T holders receive yield \(r\) (or proportional); \(\overline{T}\) holders receive 0.
- If "No," \(\overline{T}\) holders receive yield; T holders receive 0.

### Market Dynamics
- **Initial State**: T at 0.03 USDC (low odds), \(\overline{T}\) at 0.97 USDC.
- **On Success**: T price surges (e.g., to 0.8 USDC); T holders earn dividends.
- **Long-Term Potential**: A $100 investment in T may yield nothing for years but could generate $500/year in dividends upon success, plus capital gains.

### Advantage Over Expiring Markets
Unlike Polymarket, where users repurchase contracts each season, PPTs allow supporters to buy and hold a single position covering all future seasons, capturing long-term trends.
