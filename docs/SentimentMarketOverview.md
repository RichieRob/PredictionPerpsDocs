# Sentiment Market Overview

A sentiment market is a platform where users can trade positions on subjective questions or topics, similar to prediction markets but without any resolution or final outcome. Prices fluctuate based purely on public sentiment, popularity, and trading activity.

## Key Features

### Market Example: "Which political party is most trusted to run the UK economy in 2025?"
Users can take positions on specific parties, such as:

- Conservative Party
- Labour Party
- Liberal Democrats
- Green Party
- Reform UK
- Scottish National Party (SNP)
- Plaid Cymru
- Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
- Sinn Féin
- Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP)
- Alliance Party of Northern Ireland

The sum of the implied probabilities of all back positions equals 1 iUSDC. Users can back or lay each position, and prices shift based on sentiment and trading volume.

### Trading Mechanics
Functions like a prediction market—users buy/sell positions, and you can cash out at any time based on current market prices.

### No Resolution
Unlike traditional prediction markets, there's no end date or objective resolution; it's ongoing and driven by sentiment shifts.

### Collateral
Positions are backed by an interest-bearing token (iUSDC), which represents 1 USDC deposited into Aave (a lending protocol) at the start of the market. This allows:

- Holdings to appreciate over time due to accrued interest.
- Liquidity providers to avoid opportunity costs from forgone interest, as the collateral grows passively.

In essence, it's a perpetual sentiment-trading system with built-in yield to encourage long-term participation and liquidity.
