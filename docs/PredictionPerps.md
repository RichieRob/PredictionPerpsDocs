# What are Prediction Perps
## Introduction
- Prediction Perps are a new DeFi asset class which revolutionizes prediction markets.
- Central to Prediction Perps is our native yield-bearing stablecoin ppUSDC.
## Yield-Bearing Stablecoin Explained
- **What is ppUSDC?** ppUSDC is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to USDC, functioning exactly like Aave’s aUSDC.
- **How does it generate yield?** USDC is deposited into DeFi protocols, like Aave, which lend it out to borrowers, earning interest.
- **Automatic growth**: This interest is automatically passed to ppUSDC holders, increasing their balance over time without any active management.
- **Creation and burning**: New ppUSDC is created when USDC is deposited and burnt when USDC is withdrawn, mirroring aUSDC’s mechanics.
## PredictionPerps Mechanism
- **Splitting USDC**: 1 ppUSDC can be split into 1 red and 1 green share for various markets. Equally, 1 red and 1 green share from any market can be joined to form 1 ppUSDC.
- **Red and green shares**: These pairs represent opposing positions, for example, a bullish (green) or bearish (red) stance on a football team’s performance.
- **Comparison to other systems**: This functionality is similar to Polymarket’s use of the Gnosis Conditional Token Framework, but designed for perpetual markets.
- **Yield distribution**: When ppUSDC is split into green and red shares for a specific market, the yield is split between the green and red shares.
- **Market-specific rubrics**: Each market has a rubric for splitting the interest between the green and red tokens according to various conditions.
- **Example**: In a football team performance market, wins increase the share of interest on the green side, while losses increase the share of interest on the red side.
## Decentralisation
- **Decentralised protocol**: PredictionPerps operates without centralised control, enabling its tokens (ppUSDC, red, and green shares) to be used across the DeFi ecosystem.
- **Interoperability**: Tokens can integrate with various DeFi platforms, ensuring flexibility and accessibility for users.
## Liquidity Provision
- **Liquidity pools**: PredictionPerps creates pools to support trading of red and green shares, with rewards distributed to staked liquidity provider (LP) tokens.
- **Yield delegation**: The applicable yield from the pools is delegated to the LP staking contract to prevent price drift.
- **Uniswap V2**: Initial liquidity is provided through Uniswap V2, with rewards split among staked LP token holders.
- **Future scalability**: Similar strategies will be implemented for Uniswap V3 and V4, optimizing liquidity provision and reward distribution.
## Liquidity Rewards
- **Pool fees**: Liquidity providers earn 0.3% trading fees from Uniswap V2 pools for facilitating red and green share trades.
- **Yield from positions**: Providers receive yield from ppUSDC and red/green shares held in the liquidity pools, distributed through the LP staking contract.
- **Governance tokens**: Governance tokens are distributed to liquidity providers via a deflationary emission schedule, incentivizing sustained participation.
## Protocol Revenue
- **Initial phase**: The protocol initially operates without generating revenue, utilizing Aave’s retail lending rates to distribute yield to ppUSDC holders.
- **Future revenue model**: Revenue can be generated by capturing the spread between lending and deposit rates, similar to Aave’s model.
- **Development or partnerships**: The protocol may develop its own lending services or partner with DeFi protocols to secure rates more favorable than retail, allowing the protocol to retain a portion of the interest.
- **Revenue source**: Profits are derived from managing a large volume of deposits and retaining a percentage of the interest generated.
## PredictionPerps Lab Revenue
- **Trading bots**: PredictionPerps Lab may develop and deploy trading bots that leverage market inefficiencies or arbitrage opportunities within the protocol or across DeFi ecosystems, generating revenue through optimized trading strategies.
- **Strategic investments**: The lab can invest in promising DeFi projects, protocols, or tokens, earning returns through capital appreciation or yield-generating opportunities, similar to Uniswap Labs' investment strategies.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborations with other DeFi platforms, exchanges, or blockchain projects can create revenue streams through shared fees, co-developed products, or integration incentives, mirroring models used by entities like Uniswap Labs.
- **Additional services**: The lab may offer premium tools, analytics, or customized solutions for traders and liquidity providers, creating revenue through subscriptions or service fees, akin to value-added services provided by other DeFi labs.
## Roadmap
- **Growth targets**: Over the next five years, PredictionPerps aims to maximize total value locked (TVL) in its markets, targeting $10 billion. The governance token is projected to reach a market capitalization of $1 billion.
- **Context**: For comparison, Aave’s governance token currently has a market cap of $4.7 billion with a total value locked of $33 billion (source: CoinGecko).
- **Mainnet deployment**: The protocol will initially launch on mainnet, serving as the primary trading platform for centralized exchanges to offer PredictionPerps to their users.
- **Network expansion**: As liquidity grows, instances will be deployed on other networks, with listings on exchanges to enhance accessibility.
- **Mainnet advantages**: Operating on mainnet enables the use of Uniswap’s limit order book and Uniswap X for smart liquidity sourcing, providing greater flexibility in trading.
