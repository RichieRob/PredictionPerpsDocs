# Premier League Champion Market

The Premier League Champion Market is a perpetual prediction market where users trade tokens representing which club will win the Premier League. Unlike traditional markets, it never resolves—instead, holders of the winning club’s token inherit yield rights for the following season. 

## Key Features
**Market Example**: "Who will win the Premier League?"  
Users can take positions on any Premier League club, such as:
- Arsenal
- Liverpool
- Manchester City
- Manchester United
- Chelsea
- Tottenham Hotspur
- Newcastle United
- Aston Villa
- …and all other Premier League clubs

Each club has its own token (e.g., Liverpool Champion). Prices fluctuate based on trader sentiment and confidence.

## Collateral, Minting, and Burning
- **Collateral**: The market uses USDC.
- **Minting**: Anyone can mint a complete set of team tokens (one for each club) by depositing 1 USDC.
- **Yield**: The 1 USDC is deposited into Aave, where it earns interest.
- **Burning**: A user with a complete set of tokens can burn them to redeem the 1 USDC principal.

This ensures the system remains fully collateralized, and liquidity providers face no opportunity cost since collateral is always interest-bearing.

## Yield Rights Instead of Resolution
- Each Premier League season crowns one champion.
- Holders of the winning club’s token receive:
  - All Aave interest generated by the collateral during the following season.
  - Other tokens remain tradable but do not earn yield.

**Example**:
- You mint a set of tokens with 1 USDC.
- The USDC is deposited into Aave, generating interest.
- If Liverpool win the 2028/29 season, holders of Liverpool Champion tokens control the yield rights for the 2029/30 season, receiving yield on that 1 USDC until a new champion is crowned.

## Trading Mechanics
- Buy or sell team tokens anytime at current market prices.
- Exit early by selling tokens or burning a full set to recover the principal.
- If your team wins, your tokens grant yield rights for the next season.

## TL;DR
The Premier League Champion Market is a perpetual prediction market where users trade tokens on which club will win the Premier League. Mint a full set of team tokens with 1 USDC, which earns interest in Aave. Instead of resolving, holders of the winning club’s token inherit the yield rights for the next season, while tokens remain tradable year-round.
