## Introduction

Perpetual Bounded Phenomena (PBP)

Perpetual Bounded Phenomena are formed from a perpetual series of discrete events which have bounded outcomes. 

Examples Include:

-   Temperatures
-   Poll percentages
-   League points
-   Popularity
-   Market share

In this work, we first formalise PBPs before showing how they can be tokenized through Perpetually Bounded Tokens.
