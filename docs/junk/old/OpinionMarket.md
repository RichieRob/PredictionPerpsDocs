# Opinion Market Overview

An opinion market is a platform where users can trade positions on subjective questions or topics, similar to prediction markets but without any resolution or final outcome. Instead, prices fluctuate based purely on public sentiment, popularity, and trading activity.

## Key Features

- **Market Examples**: Questions like "Which political party is most trusted to run the UK economy?" or "What is the most important political issue in the UK today?" Users take positions (e.g., buying shares in "Conservatives" or "Economy" as the top issue).
- **Trading Mechanics**: Functions like a prediction marketâ€”users buy/sell positions, and you can cash out at any time based on current market prices.
- **No Resolution**: Unlike traditional prediction markets, there's no end date or objective resolution; it's ongoing and driven by opinion shifts.
- **Collateral**: Positions are backed by an interest-bearing token (vUSDC), which represents 1 USDC deposited into Aave (a lending protocol) at market start. This allows:
  - Holdings to appreciate over time due to accrued interest.
  - Liquidity providers to avoid opportunity costs from forgone interest, as the collateral grows passively.

In essence, it's a perpetual sentiment-trading system with built-in yield to encourage long-term participation and liquidity.
